## FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a program that prints a range of numbers chosen by the user, where multiples of ‘3’ print “Fizz” instead of the number, for the multiples of ‘5’ print “Buzz” and for numbers which are multiples of both '3' and '5', print FizzBuzz.

This code is 12 lines with full functionality of the FizzBuzz game, with the addition of allowing the user to chose a start and end range of numbers as opposed to the standard 1 - 100.
